# i3 Configuration TODO

## Completed
- [x] Fixed case-sensitive typos in border commands ($Mod → $mod)
- [x] Added modern Picom configuration with rounded corners and shadows
- [x] Added title alignment and default border settings
- [x] Verified gaps configuration is working with vanilla i3 (≥ 4.22)
- [x] Added keyboard layout switching (Ctrl+Space)
- [x] Added flameshot shortcut (Win+Shift+S)

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Consider switching to i3status-rust or waybar for modern status bar
- [ ] Replace static .screenlayout/current.sh with autorandr --batch
- [ ] Consider splitting config into logical pieces (bindings.conf, etc.)
- [ ] Test and optimize Picom performance
- [ ] Consider adding workspace indicators to status bar
- [ ] Review and optimize startup applications

## Notes
- Current gaps settings: inner 5px, outer 5px
- Corner radius: 8px
- Shadow settings: 12px radius, 15% opacity
- Window opacity: 90%

## Keybindings
- Ctrl+Space: Switch between IT and US keyboard layouts
- Win+Shift+S: Launch flameshot GUI

## Design Notes
- Using Mod4 (Windows key) as main modifier
- Keeping keybindings intuitive and consistent with common patterns
