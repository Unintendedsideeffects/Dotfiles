# SSH TERM handling is done in .zshrc to ensure xterm-256color is used over SSH
# This prevents exporting unavailable xterm-ghostty TERM to remote systems
# Note: shell-integration-features for SSH require sourcing shell integration,
# so we handle this directly in shell config for reliability
# shell-integration-features = ssh-env,ssh-terminfo
